Kay. The Engineer.
==

Hi, I'm Kay. I'm currently studying at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) to build, practice, and hone my software engineering skills. This is where I'll share anything particularly interesting that I find along the way. Please feel free to email me with questions or comments at the email link below. You can also find my github by clicking on the octopuss icon at the bottom of the page. However, most of my current work on github is the proprietary educational material of Hack Reactor and thus private.
