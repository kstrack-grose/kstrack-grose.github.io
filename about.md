Hi, I'm Kiri. I'm a full-stack software developer with a focus in Javascript and a love for productive, efficient solutions. I'm passionate about blending cutting edge technology with traditional, more stable technology to create the most intuitive and best supported products possible, such as my recent project built with a Postgres database and React Native views. My history in theatre and my love for stories have convinced me that everything in the world is art, and I will happily discuss the point. Please feel free to email me with questions or comments at the email link below. You can also find me on [linkedin by clicking here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kstrackgrose) or github by clicking on the octocat icon at the bottom of the page.
