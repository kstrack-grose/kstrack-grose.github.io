Hi, I'm Kiri. I'm a full-stack software engineer currently studying at the advanced software immersive [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) to build, practice, and hone my skills. This website is where I'll share anything particularly interesting that I find along the way! Please feel free to email me with questions or comments at the email link below. You can also find me on [linkedin by clicking here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kstrackgrose) or github by clicking on the octocat icon at the bottom of the page.
